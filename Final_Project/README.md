# Final Operations Research Project

Study of the 2008 financial crisis using nonlinear optimization, simulation theory, and game theory. 

A nonlinear solver was used in matlab to optimize investments in a portfolio with 26 assets to choose from. The optimization was run at one year intervale from 2003 to 2008. The solver results show that Goldman Sachs mortgage backed securities were percieved to have artificially low risk, making them an ideal investment and earning the majority of the portfolio's value leading into 2008.
